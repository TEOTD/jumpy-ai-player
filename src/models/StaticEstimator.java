 * Defines a contract for static estimation functions used to evaluate board positions in Jumpy3.

 * Implementations provide heuristic values representing the desirability of a board configuration
 * for a specific player. Used by search algorithms like MiniMax and Alpha-Beta for decision-making.

 *
 * <p>Example implementations:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code BasicEstimator} - Uses simple king/pawn positions as per project handout</li>
 *   <li>{@code ImprovedEstimator} - Custom heuristic with enhanced positional analysis</li>
 * </ul>
